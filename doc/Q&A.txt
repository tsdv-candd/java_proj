Q1: user is to Enter the round result from the round which Round#.txt does not exist â€“ but not all of them. 
Menu option 2 is to enter the results for 1 round only not multiple rounds.

Some examples:

At program start up the user enters 5 as the current round.

If the user chooses menu option 4 now then the current round is 5.

If the user chooses menu option 2 they will then enter the results for round 6 (the next round). 
After entering the results the current round is now 6.

If the user chooses menu option 2 they will then enter the results for round 7 (the next round). 
After entering the results the current round is now 7.
At program start up the user enters 15 as the current round.

If the user chooses menu option 4 now then the current round is 13 since only the first 13 round files could be loaded.

If the user chooses menu option 2 they will then enter the results for round 14 (the next round). 
After entering the results the current round is now 14.

If the user chooses menu option 2 they will then enter the results for round 15 (the next round). 
After entering the results the current round is now 15.

Q2.
~~
Suppose that system already have the round result until round No.13.
But when startup, user select current Round No. is 8 for example (8<13).
In that case, program will process normally (display menu, allow user to select a menu from 1~5)
Or.
Program will notify that "the current round is 13 but not 8" and stop, until user input correct current round Number?
Please confirm and answer soon because we plan to completed all abnormal case as soon as possible.
